        Michelangelo's "Rondanini Pietà" is a marble sculpture that could never be finished. On February 12, 1564, the 88-year-old Michelangelo collapsed in his Roman studio, still clutching his chisel and hammer. Six days later, he <a class="blank-link" href="https://yoyo72099.github.io/PROJECT-1-Non-linear-Space/phase-5/fourpage">passed away</a>. The statue was left forever in its unfinished state — the Virgin Mary holding the body of Christ just taken down from the cross, the two figures almost fused into one, barely distinguishable.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the fourth and final Pietà that Michelangelo created in his lifetime. In stark contrast to the smooth, perfect, classically beautiful Pietà of his youth, this sculpture is rough, unpolished, and almost abstract. Christ's body is elongated and twisted, the Virgin's face barely discernible. Some areas are only crudely chiseled into rough outlines, while others still retain the raw surface of the original marble block. The right arm was completely cut away and re-carved, leaving obvious traces of revision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Michelangelo spent twelve years repeatedly reworking this sculpture. Again and again he overturned his own vision, chiseling away completed sections to start anew. In the final years of his life, he worked on this block of marble in his studio nearly every day, as though racing against death — and yet also chasing some form of perfection that could never be reached. Biographers record that he was still modifying the sculpture just three days before his death.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unfinished form paradoxically imbues the sculpture with a power that transcends the figurative. The rough surfaces, the uncarved stone, the blurred boundaries — all of it evokes the fragility of life, the inevitability of death, and the artist's desperate longing for redemption in his final moments. Michelangelo was using this sculpture to pray for his own soul, and death ensured that prayer would never be finished.
