        Millet's "The Keeper of the Flock" is a pastoral idyll forever suspended in an unfinished state. In the painting, a shepherd sits quietly in the fields, watching over his flock. The sky, the meadow, the distant trees — these elements exist only as outlines and preliminary tones, as though veiled beneath a thin mist. Some areas retain nothing more than traces of the underdrawing, awaiting brushstrokes from an artist who would never return.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a work from the final years of Millet's life. Beginning in 1871, his health steadily declined — severe migraines, rheumatism, and sciatica tormented him. Yet he continued to create, using his brush to record the French countryside he deeply loved and the farmers who labored upon its soil. The shepherd was a subject Millet cherished throughout his life: solitary, quiet, living in harmony with nature — a reflection of the artist himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        In December 1874, the pain finally prevented Millet from standing before his easel. Bedridden, during intermittent moments of clarity, he implored his family to stay united after he was gone. On January 20, 1875, the 61-year-old painter of peasants <a class="blank-link" href="https://yoyo72099.github.io/PROJECT-1-Non-linear-Space/phase-5/fivepage">passed away</a> peacefully at his home in Barbizon. "The Keeper of the Flock," along with the other unfinished works in his studio, became the final testament to his artistic life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unfinished form bestows upon this painting a special kind of poetry. The blank canvas, the blurred outlines, the unrefined brushstrokes — these are not flaws, but traces of time standing still. Just as the shepherd in Millet's painting forever watches over his flock, this painting forever watches over a moment of completion that was never reached. Millet spent his entire life celebrating the dignity of the land and those who worked it, and death silenced that song just before its final note.
